<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>People should benefit from the fruits of their labor - a statement as dull and uncontroversial as it gets. In the current world, this benefit is achieved through the means of ownership, any product is property of the maker. What if these fruits are intangible, creations of the mind? No amount of fences, locks or doors can protect a music piece from being played once written on a sheet of paper. Reprinting of published books, copying of music sheets, sending movies over the Internet are examples of how an author loses control over the fruit of intellectual labor once that fruit is communicated to another person. Yet, it stands to reason that laws and regulations can indeed provide control to an author. If an author can turn to the government to act against any violators of the <em>intellectual property</em><span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Intangible property that is the result of creativity. <a href="https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/intellectual-property" target="_blank">intellectual property</a>.

<br />
</span></span> of the author, then the author regains back some of the control lost through the publication of the fruit of creativity. This is knows as copyright.<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The exclusive legal right, given to an originator or an assignee to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material, and to authorize others to do the same. <a href="https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/copyright" target="_blank">copyright</a>.

<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>There is, however, a fine line between allowing an author to enjoy benefit from creating knowledge and prohibitively restricting access to that same knowledge. Once a scientific discovery has been made, the idea of it cannot be contained and restricted for the benefit of one person. This fundamental tension between creators and audience, or the general public, has been the main driver of debate about copyright for the past three centuries. In recent years, perhaps temporarily, the interest of author and audience have aligned.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-copyright">History of copyright</h2>
<p>In order to understand the current legal environment around intellectual property rights and regulations, we will do a short historical overview of how it came into existence. The concept was first introduced in Britain in 1710 in an act called Statute of Anne, after the monarch at the time. The provisions of the statute provided a term of fourteen years after publication,<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Additionally, only the original author, if alive, could renew this term once for fourteen more years.<br />
<br />
</span></span> during which the author has complete control over who publishes, prints or distributes copies of the work.<span><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Parliament of Great Britain (1710). <a href="http://www.copyrighthistory.com/anne1.html" target="_blank" title="Statute of Anne">Statute of Anne</a>. (accessed on June 4th 2016)<br />
<br />
</span></span> In order to claim such right the author would need to register the work with a government institution. This monopoly of the author over the product was, however, by no means absolute. One of the requirements for publishing was providing at least ten copies of the book for the uses of libraries and universities. These limitations would further develop into what is considered fair use - exceptions to the exclusive rights given to authors for certain types of uses of the work. Another aspect of the nature of this law is the concept of the public domain. Once the exclusive rights of the author, or whomever the author transferred those rights to, expire, the work belongs to the general public and everyone is allowed to distribute it, modify it, make derivative works. Peter Baldwin, a professor of history at UCLA and author of The Copyright Wars: Three Centuries of Trans-Atlantic Battle, argues that “<em>by limiting the duration of exploitation rights, the Statute of Anne in effect first created the public domain.</em>”<span><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Baldwin, Peter. 2014. The Copyright Wars Three Centuries of Trans-Atlantic Battle. Princeton: Princeton University Press. pg. 65<br />
<br />
</span></span> Given that formal registration of works was mandated for authors wanting to protect their works, any non-registered works were considered to be part of that public domain, although a full definition of what constitutes the public domain was lacking.</p>
<p>Copyright in the US is enshrined in the Constitution, where Congress is given the power “<em>To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.</em>”<span><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">US Constitution, Article I § 8, Clause 8<br />
<br />
</span></span> Concisely written, this clearly states several facets of any copyrights an author has. First, any such exclusive rights stem entirely from the ability of Congress to make laws. There is no room left for any claims of inherent, natural rights that belong to the author. Second, even Congress should not be entitled to provide perpetual ownership of writing and other creations of the mind. Eventually, anything that an author writes down, paints or invents becomes part of the public domain, that is - belongs to the general population. Further, the purpose for which the authors are given exclusive rights is to advance science and art,<span><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Due to the changing meaning of the word art, there has been a debate to what this particular clause refers to. One meaning of art, admittedly less popular nowadays, is “<em>a skill at doing a specified thing, typically one acquired through practice</em>” (source: Oxford Dictionaries). Engaging in the debate about the meaning of this phrase is outside of the scope of this text, yet it is worth noting that the creative arts such as painting and music composition do indeed fall under the consideration of current copyright law.<br />
<br />
</span></span> for the benefit of the populace. The Copyright Act of 1790, echoed both spirit and word of the Statute of Anne - requiring registration, providing right for the same time and mandating a copy given to the government for archival purposes.<span><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">US Congress, <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/history/1790act.pdf">Copyright Act 1790</a>. 1st Congress, 2nd session. 1790. (accessed May 30 2016).<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Notably, the Copyright Act of 1790 expressly states it does not forbid importing or reprinting anything authored by non-citizens of the US - that is, all foreign authors have no rights over their works within the US. Anyone and everyone is entitled to <em>pirate</em><span><label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Use or reproduce (another’s work) for profit without permission, usually in contravention of patent or copyright - <a href="https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/pirate">pirate</a>.

<br />
</span></span> all the works of foreign authors disregarding any copyright claims these authors have in their respective countries. Baldwin further explains that due to shared language of literary riches “<em>pirating UK books became official American policy. Not until 1891 were foreign authors grudgingly granted copyright protection in America.</em>”<span><label for="sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-10" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Baldwin, pg. 83<br />
<br />
</span></span> It took the US a full century to provide such protections. Yet a slow change of the view had began, one that would culminate with a total departure from the spirit of the original copyright laws.</p>
<h2 id="photocopies-for-change">Photocopies for change</h2>
<p>As the economic position of the US in the world changed, so did the view on copyright. Initially a pirate, due to being mainly an importer of creations of the mind, the US would become a net exporter of such products during the twentieth century. As law in the US allowed authors to transfer their intellectual property rights over to corporations, Hollywood, the music industry and publishing industry became major rights owners. Up to the middle of the twentieth century, violating copyright required a lot of organization and resources, simply because reprinting had a high barrier to entry - a book required a printing press. The invention and mass availability of photocopiers in the 1960s completely changed that.<span><label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The photocopiers became the first device used on a mass scale by consumers of information to create copies of works as opposed to professional publishers who published without consent. For a more detailed discussion see Chesterman and Lipman, 1988.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Now almost anyone could make copies of a book at a price of a few cents per page. By the 1980s, the music industry was experiencing its own photocopy effect. John Chesterman and Andy Lipman, authors of the book <em>The electronic pirates: DIY crime of the century</em>, illustrate the tremendous influence piracy had on the music industry by writing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it [the pirates’ market share] soon recovered and by 1985 was approaching $1,500 million. It was a sobering thought that the pirates were now equivalent to the second largest international conglomerate in the business [of music distribution].<span><label for="sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-12" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">John Chesterman, Andy Lipman. 1988. The electronic pirates: DIY crime of the century. London: Routledge.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The former pirates, namely the US publishing industry, had now become the victim of piracy. This development pitted authors and distributors of content, at this point books, audio recordings, films and other creations, starkly against the interest of the audience and consumers of the works. The audience became the pirate. The combination of the US becoming mainly an exporter of intellectual property and companies needing protection within the domestic market were enough to further push US copyright law away from the original spirit of the copyright clause in the Constitution. In order to achieve protection for its products abroad, the US would need to enter into international agreements.</p>
<h2 id="to-berne-and-beyond">To Berne and beyond</h2>
<p>The Berne Convention, created in 1886 and signed in Berne, Switzerland, is a an international agreement governing copyright. The convention champions different values that those codified in the Statute of Anne and early American law.<span><label for="sn-13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-13" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Baldwin, pg. 154<br />
<br />
</span></span> One of the requirements for countries within the Berne treaty was that works are automatically protected with no formal registration needed, another contrast between the approach on the two sides of the Atlantic. With regards to the length of the term during which authors enjoy exclusive rights over their works, the Berne treaty by 1948 mandated the term be at least the lifetime of the author and fifty years postmortem.<span><label for="sn-14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-14" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Baldwin, pg. 244<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>At the turn of the 21st century, US law would have abandoned completely any pretense as to protections for the general public. The US joined the Berne Convention in 1989, implementing the mandated longer terms. The year 1998 introduced two relevant pieces of legislation - the so called Bono Act and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The first prolonged the term to the lifetime of the authors, plus seventy years postmortem. The DMCA made copyright violations a crime, punishable with imprisonment for up to five years.<span><label for="sn-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-15" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Digital Millennium Copyright Act, US Code, Title 17 § 1204, Clause (a).<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Senator John Daniel lambasted in 1891 how “<em>America allowed all to drink freely of the waters of knowledge. […] ‘It is a bastile [sic] of letters which is here constructed, and not a republic.’</em>”<span><label for="sn-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-16" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Baldwin, pg. 162. Baldwin paraphrases and quotes Senator John Daniel from Virginia cautioned in 1891 right before US Congress would enact copyright protections over British authors.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Indeed, a century later copyright, supposedly stemming from the general public and enacted by Congress “<em>to promote the progress of sciences and useful arts</em>” for the benefit of the public, turned large parts of the general public into criminals. The bastille is not of letters, but an actual bastille, in the name of <del>promoting the sciences and arts</del> profits from letters.</p>

<p>Even if we assume such acts are indeed criminal and worthy of punishment comparable to involuntary manslaughter,<span><label for="sn-17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-17" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Involuntary manslaughter is punishable by a maximum of 8 years in prison, compared to intentionally violating copyright with commercial purpose - only 5 years in prison.

<br />
</span></span> the DMCA brought changes that would turn out to have severe side effects on freedom of speech. The mechanism through which copyrights would be employed for the purpose of censorship was created by a compromise struck between the desire for control of content by owners and the realities of digital content distribution. A ‘safe harbor’ was established for companies that hosted content infringing on the copyright. The company that hosted infringing content would be safe from liability if it responded to requests for takedown of that content in a timely manner. Such requests came to be known as DMCA takedown letters.</p>
<p>The danger of censorship through such DCMA takedown letters, among other copyright mechanisms used in a similar fashion, is best exemplified by the case of Myles Power (a pseudonym). An energetic young Brit, Power creates educational content on YouTube. Nicole Kobie, a science and technology journalist with contributions to The Guardian, praises Power’s website for featuring “<em>oodles of educational YouTube videos, from how to extract DNA from strawberries to making a basic jet engine at home.</em>”<span><label for="sn-18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-18" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Nicole Kobie, Censorship by Copyright: Myles Powers and abuse of DMCA takedowns, 17 Feb 2014, Alphr<br />
<br />
</span></span> Some of his videos have a far less joyous topic than strawberry DNA. In a mini series of eleven videos, Power addresses multiple flaws of a documentary called House of Numbers (2009). The documentary describes itself as an independent look on the HIV and AIDS epidemic.<span><label for="sn-19" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-19" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is the cause of AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) according to the scientific and medical communities. Some groups of people, the authors of House of Numbers included, deny the existence of the virus, the syndrome, the causes of the syndrome, the efficiency of the treatment (or any combination of the above). Some groups, whose members were interviewed for the documentary, recommend substitution of antiretrovirals (a category of medications prescribed by the medics) with ‘imagery’ and other forms of sorcery.<br />
<br />
</span></span> The New York Times describes it as “<em>a weaselly support pamphlet for AIDS denialists.</em>”<span><label for="sn-20" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-20" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Jeannette Catsoulis, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/04/movies/04house.html" target="_blank">AIDS from a different angle</a>, Sep 3 2009<br />

</span></span> Power made a series of videos where he critiques the lies about the sequence and dates of HIV tests made by House of Numbers.<span><label for="sn-21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-21" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Myles Power, <a href="https://mylespower.co.uk/2014/02/09/the-dmca-situation/" target="_blank">The DMCA situation</a>, 9 Feb 2014,<br />

</span></span> He insists on the danger posed by the movie by saying that “<em>the film is implying that condoms are pointless […] and this is the point when the film changes from just batshit [sic] crazy to an actual health hazard.</em>”<span><label for="sn-23" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-23" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Same video, at time 12:10<br />

</span></span> The producers of the movie respond by filing multiple DMCA takedown requests to YouTube, where the critical videos were hosted. Since YouTube (and its parent company Google) are required to respond to such cases in a timely manner to avoid legal liability. The company created an automated system that reviews incoming requests and takes down videos in response. This automated system ultimately took down Power’s series of videos debunking House of Numbers. Power was initially intimidated, fearing the high legal cost of trial. After posting a video describing the situation in detail, he was contacted by multiple lawyers and organizations, which helped him challenge the DMCA takedowns.<span><label for="sn-24" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-24" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Myles Power gives an account of the events in a video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k25d5AEYBpE&amp;list=PLthPsWmE3cec-DqXSC8sT3hCW9c9Zu4v8&amp;index=7">Update and yet more DMCAs</a>.

</span></span> YouTube intervened and restored Power’s videos.</p>
<p>The court actually never got involved. The happy outcome in this case was a result of one company, Google, deciding to risk going to court over the dispute. However, as one can see in Power’s videos, the threat of being sued and the high costs associated with that.</p>
<h2 id="liberating-knowledge">Liberating knowledge</h2>
<p>We established how copyright transformed from a law that incentivized authors to create and invent into a law that justifies imprisonment over pirating knowledge, an unthinkable crime a century earlier, and a tool for censorship. Despite such severe side effects, it is necessary to explore how well does this legal regime actually serve the purpose of promoting the sciences and arts. The reasoning is rather simple - by economically incentivizing authors, scientists and inventors, they will forward the state of scientific knowledge, which in turn benefits society. Establishing who reaps the majority of profits from publishing and distribution of works is a major question with regards to the validity of the above reasoning. If the largest part of the profits is instead reaped by the publishers, who package and distribute scientific knowledge, then the incentive does not fit the above argument. If such a hypothesis is true, there is a stark difference between the goal of the copyright legal regime and the actual outcome.</p>
<p>Vincent Larivière, Stefanie Haustein and Philippe Mongeon published an article titled “The Oligopoly of Academic Publishers in the Digital Era” in June, 2015.<span><label for="sn-25" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-25" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Larivière V, Haustein S, Mongeon P. (2015). <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0127502" target="_blank">The Oligopoly of Academic Publishers in the Digital Era</a>. PLoS ONE 10(6): e0127502. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0127502 (accessed on June 3rd 2016)<br />
<br />
</span></span> The study analyses more than 44 million scientific papers, published over the forty year timespan of 1973-2013. The findings of this research include some highly alarming statistics. “<em>Combined, the top five most prolific publishers account for more than 50% of all papers published in 2013.</em>”<span><label for="sn-26" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-26" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Ibid.<br />
<br />
</span></span> This percentage has been steadily rising over the 40 year period across all fields of science. At the beginning of the period, most fields had about 20% of the papers published the five majors publishers. By 2013, most fields depended on the publishers for more than 50% of articles. These for-profit multinational corporations exert tight control over scientific knowledge. As an example of the outcome such control provides, we can consider the profits of Reed-Elsevier, the largest publisher. Data from the same studies shows that profit margins of the company’s Scientific, Technical &amp; Medical division never fell below 30% and steadily rose to 38.9% by 2013. Other large publishing companies have achieved similar profit margins - Springer Science+Business Media a profit margin of 35.0% in 2012, Taylor and Francis - 35.7%. The main clients of these publishing companies are libraries, as they can afford the high subscriptions costs. Ironically, many of those libraries are part of universities with research departments, who need the subscriptions so that faculty can conduct more research, which ends up being published in those same journals. To add insult to injury, publishing in journals actually costs money to the scientists, potentially in the thousands of dollars for a single article.<span><label for="sn-27" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-27" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Richard Van Noorden, 2013. Open access: The true cost of science publishing. Nature magazine<br />
<br />
</span></span> Within such context, any claims as to how this legal regime stimulates scientific progress, must be completely rejected. Scientific progress is made despite the near monopoly on publication that has been established by large publishing companies. Neither scientific authors, nor the general public benefits from this regime. There is no tension between author and audience. Private companies that contribute nothing, yet profit at an incredibly healthy rate.</p>
<p>In 2008, Aaron Swartz wrote that the “<em>world’s entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations.</em>”<span><label for="sn-28" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-28" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Aaron Swartz, 2008. <a href="https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt" target="_blank">Guerilla Open Access Manifesto</a>. (accessed on June 4th, 2016).<br />
<br />
</span></span> Although not quantified as well as with the Larivière study above, Swartz had gotten the facts right. In the Guerilla Open Access Manifesto, Swartz urged the reader to engage in the “<em>grand tradition of civil disobedience and declare opposition</em>” to the theft of knowledge perpetrated by private companies. He made his call to action - take information, make copies and share it with your friends. And Swartz followed through on his own his own call.</p>
<p>In 2008 Swartz and Carl Malamud downloaded 20 million pages of public court records from a government system known as the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER).<span><label for="sn-29" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-29" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Carl Malamud, 2013. <a href="https://public.resource.org/crime/" target="_blank">On Crime And Access to Knowledge. An Unpublished Essay</a><br />
<br />
</span></span> To understand why downloading 20 million pages of documents can be legal, we need to consider that the scope of works protected by copyright in the US encompasses films, music and books, but also scientific articles in journals and lectures. However, as access to the law is a requirement of the US legal system, federal and state law, court opinions and filings are not copyrightable, that is - outside the scope copyright law. Hence, the court records in PACER are in the public domain. As a result, anyone is entitled redistribute the documents. The people at PACER however, had different ideas about the control they can exert over court documents. As a way of financing the institution, it charges a small per-page fee of $0.10 in order to access a page. Or $2.40 per audio file.<span><label for="sn-30" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-30" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.pacer.gov/documents/epa_feesched.pdf" target="_blank">Public Access to Court Electronic Records</a>. Electronic Public Access Fee Schedule.<br />
<br />
</span></span> In 2008, PACER charged only 8 cents per page. Malamud claims that “<em>from their [PACER’s] point of view we had ‘taken’ over $1.6 million of ‘their’ documents without authorization because we had used a loophole to do our download.</em>”<span><label for="sn-31" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-31" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Malamud.

<br />
</span></span> The loophole being referred to is that PACER had provided free access to the documents at 17 libraries across the country. So the Administrative Office of the US Courts, operator of PACER, sent the FBI on Swartz and Malamud. The FBI did not find any violations.</p>
<p>In January 2011, Swartz was arrested.</p>

<p>On July 14, 2011, federal prosecutors charged Swartz with four felony counts, including wire fraud, computer fraud, theft of information from a computer and recklessly damaging a computer. Then on Sept. 12, 2012, prosecutors filed a superseding indictment with thirteen felony counts.<span><label for="sn-32" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-32" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Kim Zetter. 2013.

</blockquote>
<p>After two years of prosecution, facing potentially up to 50 years imprisonment and $1 million in fines, Swartz committed suicide on early January 2013. His crimes? Downloading 40 million academic papers from JSTOR, a subscription service. Swartz had allegedly accessed a closet at MIT, connected a laptop to the network and downloaded troves of scientific articles. He had not distribute them. No commercial exploitation for personal gain had happened. JSTOR and MIT, the supposed victims, refused to press charges. Yet, “<em>the Justice Department pushed forward with prosecuting Swartz, with U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz insisting that ‘stealing is stealing.’</em>”<span><label for="sn-33" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-33" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Ibid.<br />

</span></span></p>
<p>Perhaps Senator John Daniel of Virginia was indeed correct and copyright law has morphed into a bastille of letters. A bastille of censorship. Of imprisonment over access to knowledge. Of burdens on science and scientist. Copyright law needs no reform, but a complete overhaul.</p>

<h2 id="faq-frequently-avoided-questions-an-alternate-ending">FAQ (Frequently Avoided Questions): an alternate ending</h2>
<p>I imagine Swartz, once a freshman at Stanford in the Class of 2008, sitting in the same cubicle at Green library, more than ten years ago, pondering some hard questions. Ultimately, he made his decisions. Now it is my turn to ponder some hard questions. What do I believe to be the correct approach to resolving the aforementioned tension between the public good and an author’s claim over fruits of intellectual labor? Pondering as much as I desire, what action shall I take? How radical am I prepared to be in the defense of my beliefs? Am I willing to be arrested? Go to jail? Risk my freedom, potentially life? Clearly, the consequences of my actions could be ruinous.</p>
<p>So what can I do as an individual? If I believe that knowledge is being paywalled, kept private to extract rent from what is ultimately the general public’s property, is there any immediate action I can take to change that? This year, as part of Stanford’s general requirements, I produced five articles. I spend hours carefully researching topics, reading books, articles, going through blog posts, YouTube videos, legislation and court cases. Admittedly, the quality of these articles may not be high. Facts could be wrong, my opinions - biased. Yet, each of those articles - three for the Program in Writing and Rhetoric, including this piece of writing, and two written for the requirements of the Thinking Matters class - brings light to certain issues. Each of those articles engages in a debate in diverse topics such as genocide and war in Cambodia during the 1970s, interpretation of a Polish film from 1962 and copyright law. Each of those articles went through multiple revisions on my part, a peer review with another student in the class, each article was provided feedback by experts on the topic, experts in writing or both. Hundreds of hours of mental labor put into producing them. And the outcome is that these works gather virtual dust on servers. The Google Docs server, the Coursework server, it does not matter. I am an author. I am, to a certain degree, entitled to control over those works. How can I claim to believe in distributing knowledge for the public good if my own knowledge ends up being stashed away, forgotten?</p>
<p>Being consistent with those beliefs might require me in the future to refuse publishing in ‘prestigious’ journals, setup in the direction of hiding knowledge and exploiting it for profit. But does it require me to break to the law in the name “<em>opposition to […] private theft of public culture</em>”?</p>
<p>So what can I do as an individual within the Stanford community? Five papers more, five papers less, a sceptic reader might say, it makes no difference. But that sceptic read would need to consider that within the Stanford Class of 2019 there is more than 1700 students. A back-of-the-envelope calculation highlights this means more than 8000 papers are being researched, drafted, written, reviewed, revised every year.<span><label for="sn-34" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-34" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Admittedly, this number is a rough estimate. It’s derivation comes from the estimate that 1700*5=8500. It fails to take into account that some students satisfy the general requirements with the so called Education as Self-Fashioning program, or are part of the Structured Liberal Education program. Each of these two programs, the Program in Writing and Rhetoric and the Thinking Matters series of classes have highly varying and different requirements. All of them, however, push the student into rigorous thinking and exploration of ideas. All of them require the student to deeply engage knowledge, in one form or another.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Every year eight thousand papers end up gathering virtual dust to no end. With access to more than 6.5 million books, thousands of databases and journals, we write for writing’s sake. Could we do better? Could we publish a few of those articles, in the spirit of the call to action made by Aaron Swartz? Not the ones we have access to, the ones we as students, author.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are traces of five undergraduate student-run journals at Stanford.<span><label for="sn-35" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-35" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">According to a Stanford page titled ‘<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/publicknowledge/cgi-bin/pkdrupal/" target="_blank">Journals at Stanford</a>’ (accessed on June 2nd 2016).<br />
<br />
</span></span> One never seems to have published an edition. Two of them had their last volumes issued in 2008 and 2009 respectively. The remaining two - the Stanford Undergraduate Research Journal (SURJ) and Intersect: the Stanford Journal of Science, Technology and Society - are still active, having published their last issues this year.<span><label for="sn-36" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-36" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote"><a href="http://surj.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">The Stanford Undergraduate Research Journal</a> and <a href="http://ojs.stanford.edu/ojs/index.php/intersect" target="_blank">Intersect</a>. (Both accessed on June 2nd 2016.)<br />
<br />
</span></span> <em>Intersect</em> has published content that originates within the PWR program.<span><label for="sn-37" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-37" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">An example of a published article is “<a href="http://ojs.stanford.edu/ojs/index.php/intersect/article/view/825" target="_blank">Wedding Processions and the Case for Universal Hearing Aid Insurance</a>” by Zina Jawadi, published in <em>Intersect</em> (accessed on June 4th 2016). A rubric from March and April titled <a href="https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/teachingwriting/student-spotlight" target="_blank">Student Spotlight</a> features several such publications.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>The Program in Writing and Rhetoric describes the results of its approach as “<em>students [gaining] knowledge and skill […] in making an impact through their participation in conversations, including research conversations.</em>”<span><label for="sn-38" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-38" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/pwr/explore/rhetorical-approach-writing-stanford" target="_blank">A Rhetorical Approach to Writing at Stanford</a>, Program in Writing and Rhetoric, Stanford University. (accessed on June 2nd 2016).<br />
<br />
</span></span> But who do students engage in conversation with? The requisite interaction is with a peer within the class and the class instructor. By writing the text-in-conversation assignment, a student dives into a certain topic. Initially more as an observer, the research-based argument forces the student into being a full-fledged party to the argument. Yet, this debate never actually materializes, as, chances are, nobody will ever read the student’s contribution, let alone reply to the argument. An option to voluntarily pursue publication of the work, if the student is inclined to, empowers the student to become a full-fledged participant in the conversion.</p>
